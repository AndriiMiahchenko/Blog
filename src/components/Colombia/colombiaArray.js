        text: 'On day 1, arrive in the capital city of Colombia: bustling Bogota. This city is often missed in favor of other cities on a Colombia itinerary. However, it’s well worth staying for a few days. The city is a melting pot of old and new—a place where towering glass skyscrapers fill the spaces between old colonial buildings and mammoth murals. Wake up on day 2 and enjoy a typical Colombian breakfast of Bandeja Paisa before joining a street art tour. On the tour, you’ll learn about the work of CRISP and the turbulent history between street artists and police. However, these days, artists have far more creative freedom in Bogota as they’re less likely to face persecution. Because of this, you’ll find colorful murals painted all around the city.',

Although the journey is long, it’s well worth it when you reach the otherworldly landscapes of Tatacoa. The temperatures here are very hot. However, it does get an unusual amount of rainfall, making it greener and not technically a ‘desert’. ',

Make sure to keep your eyes open for fantastic views as you worm up into the green mountains of Colombia’s most famous coffee region. Salento is one of the most beautiful places to visit on your 3-week Colombia itinerary. Nestled deep in the mountains and the coffee highlands, it’s home to some of the most epic scenery in the country, including the legendary Cocora Valley. Here, you’ll find the world’s tallest palm trees towering over green rolling hills as the mountain mist creeps in.',

On day 12, explore the sights in this natural paradise, including the blue lagoon and the Marinka Waterfall. Both spots are also great for a dip and are walkable from the village, although the hot temperatures of the day can make it a little harder. For this reason, we recommend using a motorcycle taxi to get around.',

Cartagena showcases city life unlike any other place on your Colombia 3-week itinerary. It’s not got the urban feel of cities like Bogota and Medellin.

    text: 'Colombia has a reputation for being unsafe, mainly because of drug cartels, gangs, and guerilla warfare. Its history has been turbulent. However, in general, things have been looking up in recent years. We had a very positive experience and always felt safe. However, as with all destinations, always exercise caution. For example, stick to safe neighborhoods, don’t walk down dark streets at night, and keep anything valuable locked up at your hotel.',
