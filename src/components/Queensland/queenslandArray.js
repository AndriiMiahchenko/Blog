        text: 'Burleigh Heads is an all-time family favourite of ours and a beach we always return to on any trip to the Goldy! I love to start the day by watching the magnificent sunrise and the surfers taking on the world-class surf break on the point. It’s a magical spot as the colours in the sky light up in pinks and reds as the waves roll in. Grab an early morning takeaway coffee from Nook Espresso and sit on the hill and enjoy mother nature, and the surfers.',

        text: 'Cooly is a special place for us. Back in 2001 I took Caz on a surprise weekend getaway and during a sunset walk along the beach, proposed to her. Luckily she said yes. The beach is golden, the water is great for body surfing (and solid waves for the surfers out there) and a morning walk or run along the sand or the pedestrain footpath makes for a great start to any day.',

The corner section is perfect for swimming with kids and there’s also an excellent wave coming off the point for the surfers to enjoy. There’s an elevated walkway around Greenmount Headland,which gives you top views back over Coolangatta, Surfers Paradise and the guys riding the waves. And the surf club is another good spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner.',

This beach is famous for the surf break of “Snapper Rocks,” which is known as one of the world’s longest and most consistent point breaks and holds the annual Quiksilver Pro World Surfing Event.',

        text: 'I’m not usually a fan of long, open and pounding surf beaches but 75 Mile Beach on Fraser Island, the world’s largest sand island, is special. 75 Mile Beach is actually classed as part of the Bruce Highway with strict road rules and cops around ready to nab those who speed or drink drive. You need a serious 4wd vehicle to take on Fraser and be mindful of the tides so you don’t get cut off. Highlights of driving along this beach include Eli Creek, the Maheno shipwreck, seeing wild dingos roaming and taking a scenic flight to get a great perspective of the beach and the island from the air.',

It’s almost the perfect beach town with a great beach complimented by a strip of lovely cafes, BBQ areas and kids playgrounds. The beach is lovely for a morning walk or run, and the water beckons swimmers, surfers, and body boarders. Another activity we loved was walking the pathway which runs parallel to the beach around to the rock wall and point and watching the sun set back over the town.',

One of the few beaches along Australia’s coastline that faces north, Noosa is a great family beach or for those not that confident in the ocean due to its gentle waves and surf lifesavers on patrol. If you want to take a surf lesson, Noosa is deal for beginners.',

        text: 'Located 60km off the main highway between Brisbane and Cairns, Agnes Water doesn’t get the high concentration of visitors that many other Queensland beaches get, and this sleepy beach town was a great discovery on our road trip up the Queensland coast. Conveniently we were staying at the Agnes Water Caravan Park at the southern end of the beach and the moment we walked onto the sand we knew we’d found a match. Lovely natural looking beach with gentle waves for our kids and famous amongst surfers as being the most northerly beach on the east coast to regularly receive surf.',

The crystal clear water, the pure white sand, the coral, and the national park as a backdrop made for a postcard setting.',

When you can’t swim in the beach due to stinger season (November to May) there’s an awesome man-made lagoon on the foreshore perfect for families, plus with nearby playgrounds and plenty of cafes, bars and pubs lining the strip and a ton of accommodation choices from backpackers to 5 star it offers the complete package.',
