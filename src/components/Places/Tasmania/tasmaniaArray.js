        text: 'We enjoyed half a day exploring the historic sites and taking a stroll along the river before grabbing a bite to eat at the Richmond Hotel followed by coffee and cake at the popular bakery. Richmond is home to Australia’s oldest bridge (built in 1825) and Australia’s oldest Roman Catholic church, St John’s. You should also check out the Richmond Gaol and just wander around town looking at the numerous heritage-listed buildings. Richmond is lovely.',

It’s a small town with a few shops and cafes – don’t miss Tombolo Restaurant and coffee bar for great coffee + wood fired pizzas with stunning views (see picture below). This town is mostly known as the main entrance point to Freycinet National Park (our favourite place in Tasmania). Nearby Honeymoon Bay is a brilliant and consider going kayaking in the beautiful bay. We could easily spend a week based here exploring Freycinet and all it’s walks.',

It’s a small port town and from where we did our cruise down the famous World Heritage Gordon River, one of the highlights of our month in Tassie. We also saw one of the best sunsets we have ever seen anywhere setting over Strahan.',

We really enjoyed the vibe of the town, Kalyra liked the big Penguin dressed in a Santa suit, and the local markets were a hit with Caz. Nearby don’t miss Turners Beach Berry Patch (great for the kids), Hellyers Road Distillery in Burnie, the coastal drive to Ulverstone, and the Nut in Stanley. We stayed at the Penguin Waterfront Escape Apartments right in the centre of town with awesome views over Bass Strait.',

It’s a former mining town on the banks of the Pieman river and at the end of the Tarkine (the largest temperate rainforest in Australia) and the northern most point where the famous Huon pine grows. Stay in a rustic cottage, walk amongst the rainforest, kayak down the river or take a cruise on the historic Arcadia II. Access to Corinna is by barge boat (if coming from Strahan) and is a unique experience in Tasmania away from the mass tourism.',

It’s a National Trust classified Georgian village with unspoiled heritage buildings making it a popular place for tourists and easily accessible from Launceston. Clarendon House, just outside of the village, is said to be one of Australia’s greatest Georgian houses. We devoured a coffee and cake at the Ingleside licensed bakery cafe located inside the old Council chambers built in 1867. There is a pretty courtyard bursting with flowers or, in the winter, a cozy roaring fire.',

Port Arthur has a violent and troubled history as a penal colony for some of Australia’s hardened convicts. It’s one of the best things to do in Tassie and you’re based in Hobart it’s accessible via a day trip. For a great bite to eat, don’t miss the Doo-Lishus food truck at nearby Eaglehawk Neck for the best fish and chips in Tasmania, plus homemade scallop, rabbit, and venison pies.',

Walk the historic Battery Point, wander Salamanca Place and admire the sandstone buildings, check out the famous Salamanca Markets and don’t miss the fascinating MONA museum, and that’s a recommendation coming from us non-museum people.',
