It was also the capital city at one point before it was moved across to Valletta. One of the best things to do in Malta is to jump on the local boat, cruising around the city’s edges before arriving in Birgu. The traditional Maltese boats are painted in bright primary colors and look very similar to those in Venice. ',

The quirky style of houses against the cliffs and the Caribbean-looking water is a sight to remember. A must-see on your trip to Malta!',

The natural pool shape has been created by the white rock arch surrounding it, and it’s a beautiful place to spend a day. Climb down the ladders into the refreshing turquoise water to cool off from the hot sun or snorkel and see marine life. If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, skip the ladders, and jump straight from the edge into the deep pool below. Bliss!',
