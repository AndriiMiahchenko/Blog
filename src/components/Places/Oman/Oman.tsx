                    Oman is a country at the border of the United Arab Emirates.
                    Itâ€™s a 1-hour flight from Dubai or a 9-hour flight from
                    Amsterdam and brings you a real Arab experience. Oman has
                    countless sand dunes, green ravines filled with palm trees,
                    huge mountain ranges, emerald green natural pools, and a
                    massive part of the country is located on the seaside. Read
                    this complete Oman travel guide.
