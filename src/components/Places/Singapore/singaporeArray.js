        text: 'Singapore’s Cloud Forest is part of the ‘city garden’ concept. This forest inside a glass dome looks like it arrived straight out of space. Inside the dome is the mist of a 35-meter high waterfall that welcomes you. From there, see many kinds of different rare plants from all over the world. You will be able to take the elevator up to the Treewalk top where you can walk around and admire 6 different levels of the futuristic forest. Behind all of this is a very, very good lesson: Learning about rare plants and their fast-disappearing environment. The entrance price for the forest is $15 USD and it is open from 9 AM – 9 PM.',

If you’re looking for a creative boost or just a cool Instagram Story, wander around here for an afternoon. Next to Haji Lane is Muscat Street, part of the Arab Quarter. It owns many good Turkish restaurants, shops, and a beautiful view of the mosque. Fun fact: Muscat is the capital of Oman.',
