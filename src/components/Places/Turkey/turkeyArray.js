After a great Turkish lunch, head to Saklikent Gorge, which is a 300 meter-high and 18 kilometer-long canyon, one of the deepest in the world. This is about a 45-min drive from Kalkan. Continue your trip to the final destination, Fethiye. This is a city where you can easily wander around for two days. Paragliding is very popular and highly recommended in this area. The view from up there is unreal.',

        text: 'Cappadocia is quite a distance from the country and can be reached in a few ways. The first option: Drive back to Antalya, return the car and either fly out the same day or take a hotel for the night and fly out the next morning very early. Driving back from Fethiye to Antalya takes about 3 hours. Fly from Antalya to Kayseri. Kayseri is the best airport available to reach Cappadocia because it’s just a 30 minutes drive with a taxi to Goreme (a town in the Cappadocia area). The second option: Return the car at Dalaman or Pamukkale and take a touring bus to Goreme, Cappadocia. The bus will take you overnight to Goreme and can save you money but it doesn’t save you energy. (Bus rides can be pretty hectic)',

Other than the balloons, you can do a sunset ride on a horseback, stay in one of the many cave hotels, visit Pasabag or the Open Air Museum, and many more things.',
