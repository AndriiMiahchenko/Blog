The Treasury is the most beautiful and well-known sight in Petra. For a more unique perspective, hike up to the viewpoint. So-called “Jack Sparrow’s”’ the look-a-likes, will offer you a guided walk to the viewpoint but that’s the illegal route. The Treasury is just a small part of what Petra has to offer.',
