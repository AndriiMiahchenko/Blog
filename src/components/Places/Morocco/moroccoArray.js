        text: 'The nearest airport to Chefchaouen is Tangier Airport. From Tangier, it’s a 2-hour drive by taxi or a 4-hour drive on the CTM bus. The bus costs around 50 DH which costs a little less than $5 USD. From the airport, take a taxi to the gare routière (bus station) which is 1.5 km away. All buses including CTM will leave from here. Or you can get a rental car from the airport in Morocco. You can also split the cost of a taxi to Chefchaouen with other travelers and pay around $15 USD each.  This will save you 2 hours of driving time on the bus, and ultimately give you more time on your Morocco itinerary.',

It is an unforgettable moment on your Morocco itinerary, as you witness the rippling, orange and red sands of the Sahara Desert for the very first time. It is best to do a 3-day Sahara Desert Tour from Fes to Marrakech. From Fes to Merzouga is a spectacular 5-hour drive through beautiful landscapes and snow covering the Atlas Mountains. A 3-day tour will take you right into the Sahara desert and give you a true feel for these landscapes and the friendly people that live here.',
