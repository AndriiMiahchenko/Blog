There are hundreds of mammoth caves here, nestled between limestone mountains and wide winding rivers. Because of this, travelers can enjoy trekking, climbing, or abseiling, through tunnels and rivers. The most extraordinary of all the caves is Son Doong, big enough to fit in city skyscrapers. To reach this cave is a 4-day trek, with a long waitlist, so make sure to plan ahead if you want to incorporate this into your Vietnam travels. Many others, which are just as impressive, such as Hang En, can be visited in a day trek.',

The main way to travel in Vietnam is by bus, and although this is slower, there are excellent sleeper buses which means you  don’t have to take days off the itinerary. Good train routes operate down the coast of Vietnam, which also offer sleeper services. Vietnam has a handful of domestic airports but if you want to travel to more remote places, prepare to take the bus!',
