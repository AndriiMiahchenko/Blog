                    The Ultimate Bali Travel Guide (3 weeks)

                <p className="text">
                    Bali is popular and for good reason. The island is
                    beautiful, the beaches are perfect for a sun and surf
                    holiday, there are fantastic walks such as through the rice
                    fields or to the top of a volcano, the locals are very
                    welcoming and Bali is also very affordable. This 3-week Bali
                    itinerary includes the most beautiful sights on the island,
                    such as the waterfalls around Ubud, the impressive cliffs of
                    Nusa Penida, and the paradise beaches of Gili Air.

                    Day 1 – 2: Arrival and staying in Seminyak or Canggu

                    Flying into Denpasar Airport doesn’t mean you have to stay
                    in Denpasar after your flight. From the airport, take a taxi
                    to Seminyak or Canggu. Canggu is a laid-back, trendy
                    surf-vibe town and Seminyak is more about beautiful beaches
                    and beach clubs. Before arriving be sure to know which visa
                    for Bali, Indonesia suits your visit.

                    Day 3 – 4: Staying with a local family

                    Bali is known for its luxury and perfect island life. Have a
                    unique experience while staying with a local family in Bali.
                    You will learn so much about life, food, and culture in
                    Bali. The best part is that you will make a lot of new
                    life-lasting friendships. We stayed in Gadugan, which is a
                    1-hour drive from Canggu.

                <p className="text">
                    Many people do a day trip to the Munduk area for the temple
                    at Tamblingan Lake. Actually staying in Munduk will give you
                    the time to see even more beautiful places. The area is a
                    little cooler and can feel really comfortable. Waterfalls,
                    swings, coffee, trekking, Munduk has it all. From Gadugan to
                    Munduk is a solid 2.5-hour drive.

                <p className="text">
                    From Munduk, organize a trip to do the Bali waterfall route
                    and end your trip in Ubud. Do a one or two-day trip and be
                    amazed by Bali’s beauty. P.S. There is a driver
                    recommendation included in the next link. Ubud is a great
                    village in the center of Bali. There is so much going on
                    here like the Tegalalang Rice Terraces, countless
                    waterfalls, yoga retreats, and many more things to do in
                    Ubud.

                    After the great life in Ubud, head over to one of the
                    smallest islands you will ever be. There are no cars or
                    asphalt roads on Gili Air. Get around by bike, relax at one
                    of the many beaches, go on a search for turtles and enjoy
                    the most incredible sunsets.

                <p className="text">
                    From Gili Air, hop on the boat and go to Nusa Lembongan. It
                    takes about 3.5-hours to get from Gili to Nusa. The Nusa
                    Islands are less tropical but the vibes and views here are
                    just right. Nusa Penida can be seen on a Nusa Penida day
                    tour. However, if you have the time we recommend you to do a
                    3-day Nusa Penida trip.

                    Nusa Ceningan and Lembongan are connected via a yellow
                    suspension bridge which is just wide enough to cross it with
                    a motorbike. The life on the Nusa Islands is good and we
                    would recommend staying on Ceningan for one or two nights.
                    Nusa Ceningan is just a 20-min trip from Nusa Lembongan
                    town.

                    The last days of your trip you can either spend in Uluwatu
                    or again Canggu. Both places are close to the airport, laid
                    back and you can surf as well. We loved Canggu’s vibe and
                    stayed there.

                    Bali’s absolutely best time to visit runs from May until
                    July. However, if you are a surfer you might want to pick
                    another season. May to October is known as the best season
                    to surf around Bali.

                <h2 className="title-item">Costs of food in Bali</h2>
                <p className="text">
                    The price of food in Bali is different per city and kind of
                    meal. Eat very local food in a not too fancy-looking place
                    and you will pay $1.50 for a full plate of delicious food.
                    When eating across the road at this great-looking and
                    tasting vegan place, you probably will pay somewhere from $5
                    – $8 per meal.

                    The price of a flight ticket to Bali can be cut in half when
                    going offseason. We found our ticket deal via Skyscanner. We
                    paid €700 for a 1-stop return flight from Amsterdam, which
                    is not the cheapest but the flight was only 15 hours. With a
