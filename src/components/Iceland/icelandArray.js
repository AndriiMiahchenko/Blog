Thingvellir is the only place in the world where this is clearly visible. There is a beautiful walking path in the area and a waterfall (Öxarárfoss). Follow your way to Geysir, a famous hot spring in the geothermal area shooting boiling water about 20 meters up into the air. This happens every 5 to 10 minutes. An absolute must-see! A 1-hour drive from Geysir is the powerful Gullfoss waterfall which has a two-level 70-meter high drop.',

The waterfall can be visited from every angle which is quite unique in Iceland. Not far away is another beauty, the Skogafoss waterfall. This is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland. Close to Skogafoss is another fall: Kvernufoss. We haven’t visited it but read good stories. From the waterfall, drive all the way down to Vik and stop in between at the Solheimasandur Plane Wreck. There is a 4-kilometer walk is required to reach the sight. In the small town Vik you visit the beautifully located church and do some grocery shopping. In June, the church is surrounded by purple lupine flowers.',
